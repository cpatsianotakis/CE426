		<h2 style="color:white; text-align:center;">Something about me:</h2>
		<p style="color:white; text-align:center;"><font size="3">
			I was born in 23 September 1997 in Belgium. I have a Greek father and a Belgian mother and
			I grew up in Pombia, a village of the south of Crete. My father is an Electrical Engineer, as a result, I
			started to work on electric automation from the age of 12. Nowadays I live in the beautiful city of Volos and I am studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Thessaly. I like working mostly on Embedded Systems.
			Also I am an IEEE member and for this season (2019-2020) I am the Vice Chair of the <a style="color:44FF00" href="https://ieee.e-ce.uth.gr/"> Student Branch of University of Thessaly (Volos)</a>. I manage also (and started) the <a style="color:44FF00" href="https://www.facebook.com/AgroJasonProject/">AgroJason Project</a>, a project working on the Greenhouses automation. I do also fencing, and as a teenager I've got the 2nd and 3rd place in Greece. Also I played in the Junior World Cup which was held in Thessaloniki in 2014. Nowadays I am a National Referee of the Hellenic Federation of Fencing and I work also as a coach, focusing on developing the sport in Thessaly.
